THEME: Two button controls and / or growing.

Growing:
    - Platfomer
    - Grow your character to make him stronger
    - Maybe waves of enemies come and you see how long you can last
    - At the end of every round you can buy new weapons / upgrades
    - As you kill enemies you fill a power meter. When it fills you grow in both size and power.
    - As you get attacked they take power away and can be reverted to earlier power levels?
    - Maybe you have to lose all power to die?
    - Maybe 10 levels of power?
    - Super Slayer 1 - 10
